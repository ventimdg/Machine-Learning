Instructions: All you have to do to reproduce my results is run the appropriate .py files. If you want to reproduce the graphs in part 4d or 4f,
 you will need to comment out the scale paramamter in world_values_pipelines.py to reproduce 4f, and if you want to reproduce part 4d, you will need to 
 to switch the knn__weights back to uniform from distance in world_values_parameters.py, while keeping the change you just made to reproduce 4f.
